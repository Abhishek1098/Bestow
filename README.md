# Bestow
An Android app designed as a platform for people to give away things they no longer need to the less fortunate.
It allows people to contact each other in order to arrange to pick up items from generous people in their area, and uses a machine learning image recognition database through the Clarifai API to automatically identify any pictures posted to the app.
